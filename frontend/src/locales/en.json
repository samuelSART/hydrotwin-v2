Hindcasts for monthly mean amounts are available on a common global grid of 1∘.</p> <p>The common period for which hindcasts are available from the three forecasting systems is 1993-2020. Although additional hindcasts are available for the individual models, the common hindcast period is used for the calibration and verification of all forecast systems. It should be noted that this homogenisation of the data comes at the cost of potentially misinterpreting the skill of the (recalibrated) forecasts due to the short training and verification periods. Data from the ECMWF ERA-Interim analysis and the Segura SAHI rain gauge network are used as a reference for both training and verification.</p> <p>The final step of the prediction system is a &quot;multi-model combination&quot; system, which through machine-learning techniques described in the technical documentation delivered, is capable of making reliable predictions of the variables requested by the different lines of the project.</p> <p>Functionality With this functionality, a 15-day and 7-month weather forecast can be made with a step of 1 day.
